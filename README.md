Terraform S3 Static Website

This project uses Terraform to deploy a static website hosted on Amazon S3.
The infrastructure is fully automated using terraform/Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

Features
- S3 static website hosting
- Public read access via bucket policy
- Simple HTML deployment
- Cost-effective, serverless architecture

Notes

Again a custom domain could be added using Route 53, but was intentionally omitted
to keep the project budget-friendly.
